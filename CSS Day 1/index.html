<!-- 
CSS Display Task:
 
Open Visual Studio Code and in your workspace, I would like you to create a new index.html file and correctly link a style.css file to it.
 
In the HTML file I would like you to add an element of each display type. A block element, an inline element and an inline-block element.

Using CSS, I would like you to adjust the width and/or height of the inline-block element. I would also like you to try and work out how to hide one of the elements using the display property. -->

        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>This page is to see how inline, block and inline-block elements work.</p>

        <h2>Box-Model</h2>

        <p>Each HTML element in CSS is essentially a box. A box is made up of 4 sections; Margin, Border,
            Padding,
            Content.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Margin - The space between the element and the page border, or the surrounding elements.</li>
                <li>Border - The border that surrounds the padding and content.</li>
                <li>Padding - The space between the content and the border. Even if the border is set to 0, padding
                    still
                    sits
                    between it and the content.</li>
                <li>Content - The content is where the text or image will appear. The size of the content is determined
                    by
                    the
                    height and width properties.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="box">
            This is a box!
        </div>
